                <p id="tribute-info">These are my best friends where we met around elementary school and high school. Together we made a lot of memories with more still to come. Memorable events that tied us together in high school were clubs, sports, activities and other events in school. We would also hang out and have a great time outside of school such as in places like Burnham Park or through video games. My friends are always there when we need each other and always create great memories when we are together, which is why I am extremely grateful for them.</p>

                    <li>SP: A great Korean friend of mine where we bonded after the pandemic from our enjoyment of similar video games.</li>
                    <li>DJ: An amazing friend who joined me, SP and Leigh later towards the year. A great guy who amplified the groups energy and opened us up to new experiences</li>
